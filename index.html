          <h2>Day One: Setting Up the Hackosphere</h2>
            <p class="maintext"> Today our course in web application development with Stackademy made its shy startings. Like kids at their first day of school, we entered the co-working space of apeary that would be our classroom for the next 12 weeks.One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found himself transformed in his bed into a horrible vermin. He lay on his armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little he could see his brown belly, slightly domed and divided by arches into stiff sections. The bedding was hardly able to cover it and seemed ready to slide off any moment. His many legs, pitifully thin compared with the size of the rest of him, waved about helplessly as he looked. </p>
